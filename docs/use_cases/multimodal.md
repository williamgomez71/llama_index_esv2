# Multi-modal

LlamaIndex offers capabilities to not only build language-based applications, but also **multi-modal** applications - combining language and images.

## Types of Multi-modal Use Cases

This space is actively being explored right now, but there are some fascinating use cases popping up.

### Multi-Modal RAG

All the core RAG concepts: indexing, retrieval, and synthesis, can be extended into the image setting.

- The input could be text or image.
- The stored knowledge base can consist of text or images.
- The inputs to response generation can be text or image.
- The final response can be text or image.

### Retrieval-Augmented Image Captioning

Oftentimes understanding an image requires looking up information from a knowledge base. A flow here is retrieval-augmented image captioning - first caption the image with a multi-modal model, then refine the caption by retrieving from a text corpus.

### Using Chroma for Multi-Modal retrieval with single vector store

Chroma vector DB supports single vector store for indexing both images and texts.
Check out out Chroma + LlamaIndex integration with single Multi-Modal Vector Store for both images/texts index and retrieval.
