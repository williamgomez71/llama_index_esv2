# Putting It All Together

Congratulations! You've loaded your data, indexed it, stored your index, and queried your index. Now you've got to ship something to production. We can show you how to do that!

- In [Q&A Patterns](q_and_a.md) we'll go into some of the more advanced and subtle ways you can build a query engine beyond the basics.
  - The [terms definition tutorial](q_and_a/terms_definitions_tutorial.md) is a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on creating a subtle query application including defining your prompts and supporting images as input.
  - We have a guide to [creating a unified query framework over your indexes](q_and_a/unified_query.md) which shows you how to run queries across multiple indexes.
  - We talk about how to build queries over [knowledge graphs](graphs.md)
  - And also over [structured data like SQL](structured_data.md)
- We have a guide on [how to build a chatbot](chatbots/building_a_chatbot.md)
- We talk about [building agents in LlamaIndex](agents.md)
- And last but not least we show you how to build [a full stack web application](apps.md) using LlamaIndex
